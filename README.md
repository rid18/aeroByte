# 🌍 aeroByte AI: Smart Pollution Governance & Predictive Dashboard

**aeroByte AI** is a next-generation environmental intelligence platform. While traditional dashboards only show historical data, aeroByte AI uses predictive modeling to trigger preventive governance and personalized health interventions for the Delhi-NCR region.

## 📌 The Challenge
Delhi-NCR faces sudden PM2.5 spikes without sufficient early-warning lead time. This results in:
* **Reactive Governance:** Actions are taken *after* air quality becomes severe.
* **Economic Blindness:** No real-time tracking of the financial impact of pollution.
* **Generalized Advice:** Health warnings don't account for individual age or medical history.

## ✨ The aeroByte Innovation (Novelty)
We have built more than just a tracker; we have built a **Decision Support System (DSS)**:
* **🧠 72-Hour AI Predictive Intelligence:** Advanced forecasting to anticipate smog events before they happen.
* **☣️ AI Containment Zones:** Automated emergency protocols (Smog guns, Industrial shutdowns) triggered instantly by AQI thresholds.
* **💰 Economic Loss Engine:** Real-time calculation of daily productivity loss in ₹ Crores.
* **🏥 Personalized Health AI:** Profiles-based safety alerts tailored to age and respiratory health.
* **🌳 Oxygen Credits:** A gamified community system to reward citizens for reporting local violations.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Architecture



* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python-based interactive UI)
* **Visualizations:** Plotly (Dynamic charts), Mapbox (Live Geospatial Data)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas & NumPy
* **Backend Logic:** Python-driven Simulation Engine (IoT Stream Emulation)

## 🚀 Key Prototype Modules
1.  **Sector-wise AI Interventions:** Dynamic status updates for Traffic (Diverted) and Emission Control (Restricted).
2.  **Live Station Map:** Integrated map view for multiple hotspots (Anand Vihar, ITO, RK Puram, Dwarka).
3.  **Community Violation Feed:** A crowdsourced reporting system for garbage burning and industrial smoke.
